# Project master 2 : (Advanced MAchine Learning)

Review of the article : When and why vision-language models behave like bags-of-words, and what to do about it?
by Mert Yuksekgonul, Federico Bianchi, Pratyusha Kalluri, Dan Jurafsky, James Zou. 

## Re-implementation :
- ARO benchmark
- NegCLIP
- CLIP
- Evaluation of CLIP and NegCLIP on ARO and CIFAR100

## Contribution :

- NegCLIP_FTXT - we propose a method derived from NegCLIP to fine-tune
CLIP, which would allow better discrimination between captions and
their permuted version. 
- Evaluation of NegCLIP_FTXT on ARO and CIFAR100
